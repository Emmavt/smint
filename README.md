*smint* (Structure Models INTerpolator) is a tool to obtain posterior distributions on the envelope mass fraction of a planet based upon interpolation onto the Lopez&Fortney (2014) model grids.
The interpolator uses the Lopez&Fortney grid, extrapolated to envelope mass fractions of 100% and planet masses of 40 Earth masses (feel free to adjust in your code the upper bound on the envelope mass fraction to XX)

If you use this code, please cite Caroline Piaulet as well as Lopez&Fortney (2014): https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...792....1L/abstract
